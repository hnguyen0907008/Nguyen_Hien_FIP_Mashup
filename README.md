# Nguyen_Hien_FIP_Mashup
Final Integrated Project

## Summary
The brands I chose are Collective Arts Brewing and Lucy & Yak, specifically 'Rainbowz' Limited Edition Striped Dungarees. In this project, I combined them into "Collective Lucy & Yak Brewintg, designed beer labels inspired by Lucy & Yak's aesthetic and brand theme.

##Interaction
Most of them are array application. In the homepage, users can click into beer thumbnails to read summary of each products. In each beer information page, users can alter between beer descriptions and artwork descriptions as well as changing images.

## Dependencies

Uses CSS3 and HTML5 latest features. Be sure to prefix any bleeding-edge rules, tags, etc (see [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/) for reference). Also using latest ES6/next, you should probably think about including [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for transpilation (or an NPM script).

## Installing

cd to the directory of your choice, clone, and hack away!
